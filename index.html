                <p>My story about being a developer has lot of struggles and efforts in it but finally am a developer now
                    & doing the work i love. Personally i dont believe in degree(in normal Indian colleges) knowledge will speak.
                </p>
                <p>Since beginning my journey as a Software developer nearly 3+ years ago, 
                    I've done many interesting projects for Capgemini India Pvt LTD at Bangalore, consulted for startups, 
                    and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both 
                    business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious,
                     and perpetually working on improving my skills at Back-end Development.</p>

                     <p>I always prefer learning something related to Computer Science and technology oriented.
                     </p>

                     <p>Responsible to develop an open source framework (DevonFw) for Capgemini and also to develop web applications (backend java) for the clients of Capgemini as per Agile Methodology.
